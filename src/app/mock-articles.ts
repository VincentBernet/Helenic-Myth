Its abode is Ether - the eternal light, found in the upper part of the sky - (Jupiter among the Romans). He reigns over gods and men by restoring justice and order. Iris, the rainbow, is his messenger on Earth. Lightning is his attribute. The eagle is the symbol of his power. Zeus was born from the union of Cronos, god of time and creation, and Rhea, goddess of nature and successive movement. He owes his life to the cunning of his mother, Rhea, who opposed the deal between Cronos and his older brother, Titan. Indeed, Titan had ceded the reins of power to his younger brother Cronos, on condition that the latter never allow his children to succeed him. Thus, Cronos undertook to devour all his offspring in order to keep his rank of supreme God. He successively devoured Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades and Poseidon. Rhea, pregnant again and bruised by the death of her children, decided to save her new child and gave birth to him secretly by taking refuge in Crete, on Mount Diktéo. She entrusted the child to the nymphs, in charge of feeding it, and to the Curetes who danced with noise in front of the cave where the child was so that Cronos did not hear the baby's crying. When she returned to her husband, Rhéa offered him a stone surrounded by linen, which he immediately swallowed. So Zeus survived thanks to his mother's cunning. When Zeus, already grown up, learned the story of his birth, he rebelled against his father Cronos, calling on him to cede power to him. The latter, constrained by the determination of his son, made him his successor. Destroyed, Cronos was forced to disgurgitate his five swallowed children. Knowing nothing of Rhea's cunning, Titan accused his brother of breaking his word and chased him out of the sky. Zeus, vindictive and very angry at this injustice inflicted on his father, attacked Titan and put his father back on the throne. This episode, called Titanomachy or the war of the giants, first opposed Zeus, alone, to Titan and his brothers. Then, Cronos, having understood that the son will succeed the father no matter what, as life will always follow death, sided with Titan in order to counter fate. Zeus, armed with lightning and thunder, surrounded himself with his brothers and sisters, returned to life, and won the war against the Titans. They were also helped by Prometheus, the son of the Titan Japet, who rallied around the new generation of powerful. So the new order took over the old. The law dethroned chaos. Many wives were attributed to Zeus. It would seem that each of them shed light on the character of their husband. Thus, Métis meant intelligence, Themis and Eurynmé order and beauty, Hera, his official wife, displayed protection and anger. Zeus had four children with the latter, but also many other children out of wedlock. ", author:"Nassim" },
    { id: 2, name: 'Hera', type:"God",title: 'Goddess of Marriage', imageUrl:"https://www.lamythologie.fr/mythologie-grecque/dieux-olympiens/hera/sculptures/hera-sculpture-1.jpg",description: "Hera, one of the twelve divinities of Olympus, was both the official wife of Zeus and his sister. As a bride, she is also the queen of heaven and the gods - the female deity of heaven who shares certain characteristics with her husband. However, Hera especially protects women, marriage, family and represents legitimacy - (Juno among the Romans). She is often adorned with a veil symbolizing virginity, a royal scepter and a diadem suggesting the vault of heaven. His animal is the peacock, whose plumage is the symbol of the starry sky. Hera is of the same origin as Zeus. Their common parents are Cronos and Rhea, respectively the Time of creation and the Earth. Hera was raised by the Titan Ocean and the Titanide Thetys, the sea goddess. Zeus and Hera met in the region of the Hesperides, where the waves of ambrosia flowed - the source of eternal life. Their meeting dates before their accession as rulers of the world. The marriage, on the other hand, was celebrated after they imposed the new reign on Olympus. The formalization of their sacred union would have taken place in spring, the time of fertility and the rebirth of nature. Hera often wears flower crowns, symbols of this eternal renewal. Hera is characterized by great beauty according to Greek canons: her face is adorned with large 'bovine' eyes and a dazzling white complexion. However, she displays a serious air. Protector of morals through fidelity in marriage, she is capable of great anger whenever she learns of a new infidelity from Zeus. These anger are often associated with the storms of autumn which symbolize the marital disputes between the spouses. The divine couple had four children: Ares, Hébé, Ilythia and Héphaïstos. But, during one of her great anger against Zeus, Hera alone gave birth to Typhaon in the blast of a hurricane, thus rivaling the lightning and thunder of Zeus. She also raised many children of Zeus, born out of wedlock. Ilythia, the daughter of Hera and Zeus did not inherit the irascible character of her parents. On the other hand, she perpetuates the protection of women as the goddess of motherhood. The cult of Hera was born in Argos, the city which has dedicated many festivals and legends to it. However, the island of Samos disputes Argos for the cradle of the cult of Hera.", author:"Anis" },
    { id: 3, name: 'Apollo', type:"God", title:'God of Light and Music', imageUrl:"https://www.lamythologie.fr/mythologie-grecque/dieux-olympiens/apollon/sculptures/apollon-sculpture-1.jpg",description: "Apollo is part of the new generation of the gods of Olympus, after that of the primitive forces from Chronos and Rhea. He is celebrated as the protective God of music and poetry, the healing God too, but above all as the God of light, truth and harmony. Symbolically, Apollo is a positive divinity who favors understanding between men and Gods. He can also take on the aspect of a punitive force with his bow and arrows. Its symbol is the laurel as a victory over the darkness of winter, the protective dolphin of maritime expeditions that begin with sunny days, and the crow as the bird of prophecies. He is often depicted on a white swan or a griffin, protectors of light. Apollo, born on the island of Delos, is the son of Zeus and Leto. His mother, one of Zeus' many companions, was jealous of Hera. Therefore, she was looking for a place to give birth to her child, hiding from the wrath of Zeus' rightful wife. Thus, she landed on Delos, an infertile island, where she gave birth to her twins Artemis and Apollo. At the birth of Apollo, the island of Delos was covered with a golden light. The God of light stayed there in the summer and left again in the winter. It was associated with the benefits of the Sun, represented by ripe fruits; on the other hand, its evil aspect was represented by the fruits dried in the sun, visible at the end of the summer. At the foot of Parnassus, in Delphi, considered by the Greeks as the center of the world, the oracle of Apollo was celebrated. The oracle was pronounced by the Pythias who bore this name in memory of Apollo's victory over Python, the serpent of darkness. Hence the other names of Apollo: Délien or Pythien. As a God of light, he was also associated with the Sun, hence his name Phébus meaning 'the one who shines'. However, he was not confused with the God Helios, the true Sun God. The image of Apollo was that of a tall young man, dazzlingly beautiful, with hair long as the rays of the sun. It is the Sun which gave him the power of the healer and this power, he had transmitted it to his son, Asclepius (Aesculapius). It healed the body as well as the soul, thanks to its purifying power and its role of conciliator between humans and the Gods.", author:"Gabriel" },
    { id: 4, name: 'Athena', type:"God", title:'Goddess of Wisdom', imageUrl:"https://www.lamythologie.fr/mythologie-grecque/dieux-olympiens/athena/sculptures/athena-sculpture-15.jpg",description: "His real name is Pallas Athena (Minerva among the Romans). Daughter of Zeus and Métis, goddess of wisdom, protector of the city, families, heroes, hygiene, civilized life, crafts and agriculture. Its attributes are the olive tree, the helmet and the spear. Athena is also a warrior goddess but not hawkish. She fights external enemies. However, it is as the goddess of wisdom that she has come to prominence through the centuries and symbolizes Greek civilization. Several legends trace the origins of Athena: Ouranos would have warned Zeus that a child of Métis would succeed in dethroning him. As soon as she was pregnant, Zeus decided to swallow her to counter fate. A few months later, he began to have terrible headaches and he asked Hephaestus, his son and god of the forge, to split his head with an ax, to free him from this great pain. Thus springs Athena, adorned with a spear and a shield. Some sources consider that she was born of Zeus alone. Still others suggest that Athena is the personification of lightning. Zeus would have struck a cloud and this violent blow to the head would have made his daughter come out of this cloud. Athena is Zeus' favorite child and as such she is authorized to wear the aegis, shield and lightning. Like Hestia and Artemis, Athena is a virgin goddess. She fights alongside her father during the titanomachy. She teaches the gods the strategy of defense, advises them and guides them throughout the battles. Some sources claim that she killed the Giant Pallas, hence the name Pallas Athena. Others suggest that Pallas would come from “pallô”, brandishing arms, as the young goddess did when she was born, or even from “palax” meaning young girl. Athena's advice generally provides rules of conduct whatever the place, the relationship between people or the situation. Moreover, as the protector of heroes such as Diomedes, Perseus, Achilles, Telemachus… she appears in the guise of Mentor. She also helps Hercules to accomplish his 12 labors. During the Trojan War, she came to the aid of the Greek army. Athena also has a civilizing role through the teaching of construction techniques and agriculture that she lavishes on the population. The Parthenon is its temple whose name comes from the word 'parthenos' designating the virgin. Legends linked to Athena: the origin of the city of Athens, the legend of Cecrops, that of the Argonauts, the Trojan War, the fable of Arachne, the war of the Titans, the legend of The Gorgon.", author:"Anis" },
    { id: 5, name: 'Poseidon', type:"God", title:'God of the seas', imageUrl:"https://www.lamythologie.fr/mythologie-grecque/dieux-olympiens/poseidon/sculptures/poseidon-sculpture-5.jpg",description: "God of the seas and the humid element in all its forms: seas, rivers and springs which fertilize the earth - (Neptune among the Romans). He is also considered an earthly god because he was associated with the phenomenon of earthquakes and volcanic eruption. The Greeks believed that it was Poseidon who lifted the Earth and carried it on his shoulders, as Atlas carried the sky. Its attributes are the trident or the three-branched scepter, the dolphin, the horse, the bull. The image of the horse and the bull come from the Greek poets who symbolized the big waves in the open sea by the horses standing on their hind legs or the fury of the bulls. The dolphin, on the contrary, symbolized the calm sea. Its appearance was the forerunner of safe navigation. Its season is winter. Among the Ionians, the stormiest month at sea was called 'poseidon', denoting December and January. Bearded, with long curly hair, he is often depicted seated on a throne. Son of Cronos and Rhea, he is one of the divinities of natural phenomena. Poseidon is brother of Zeus and Hades. He crisscrosses the people in his tank pulled by the Nereids. The characteristics of this deity are very closely linked to the geographical location of Greece with its long coastlines and volcanoes. Poseidon joins forces with Zeus to dethrone Cronos, his father. Then, he allied with Apollo to overthrow Zeus, but without success. As punishment, Zeus dispossessed them of their divine attributes for a year and exiled them. Poseidon had a large number of descendants: Pegasus and Chrysaor, Pelias and Nélée, Eole, Cycnos, Polyphemus - the cyclops, Triton… Poseidon's natural power protects naval commerce. The Greeks associate their wealth and their domination in the Mediterranean with the powers of Poseidon.

Personification of dawn.Protector of loves and lovers; she weaves amorous intrigues between gods and mortals - (Venus among the Romans).Its symbols are: the myrtle, the apple, the swan, the sparrow, the dove and the dolphin. It is believed that his cult originated in Assyria, that it was transported to Phenicia (goddess Astarte), then from Phenicia to Cyprus, ending up in Laconia and the Peloponnese. His cult in Greece was mostly linked to island and coastal regions. She was one of the deities who presided over the birth of life, as the goddess of love and fertility. His armed representation probably comes from his Asian origins, hence his attachment to the Greek god Ares who thus completes his powers among the Greeks. The introduction of the figure of Aphrodite into the Greek pantheon changes the previously austere, virginal or maternal feminine image of the goddesses (Athena, Artemis, Hera, Demeter…). Aphrodite then brings the image of pleasure and loses the link with the nascent nature.Aphrodite Ourania is an older figure of this divinity, personifying marriage, family, fertility; it is opposed to Aphrodite Pandèmos, more recent, which reigns only on the union of the sexes and the desire. In archaic mythology, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione (consort of Zeus and sometimes goddess of agrarian life). At a later time, its birth is attributed to the foam of the seas. During the duel between Ouranos and his son Cronos, the latter injured his father by cutting his genitals which fell into the sea. It is from this sperm of Ouranos that Aphrodite was born. It was then that Zephyr would have transported her to the shores of Cyprus, just after her birth in Kythera, a Phoenician counter. This is the justification for its other names: Cytherea and Kypris. Aphrodite was the wife of Hephaestus, but she also succumbed to the charm of Ares with whom she had four children: Eros, Deimos (terror), Phobos (fear) and Harmony.
