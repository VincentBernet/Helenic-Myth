Its abode is Ether - the eternal light, found in the upper part of the sky - (Jupiter among the Romans). He reigns over gods and men by restoring justice and order. Iris, the rainbow, is his messenger on Earth. Lightning is his attribute. The eagle is the symbol of his power. Zeus was born from the union of Cronos, god of time and creation, and Rhea, goddess of nature and successive movement. He owes his life to the cunning of his mother, Rhea, who opposed the deal between Cronos and his older brother, Titan. Indeed, Titan had ceded the reins of power to his younger brother Cronos, on condition that the latter never allow his children to succeed him. Thus, Cronos undertook to devour all his offspring in order to keep his rank of supreme God. He successively devoured Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades and Poseidon. Rhea, pregnant again and bruised by the death of her children, decided to save her new child and gave birth to him secretly by taking refuge in Crete, on Mount Diktéo. She entrusted the child to the nymphs, in charge of feeding it, and to the Curetes who danced with noise in front of the cave where the child was so that Cronos did not hear the baby's crying. When she returned to her husband, Rhéa offered him a stone surrounded by linen, which he immediately swallowed. So Zeus survived thanks to his mother's cunning. When Zeus, already grown up, learned the story of his birth, he rebelled against his father Cronos, calling on him to cede power to him. The latter, constrained by the determination of his son, made him his successor. Destroyed, Cronos was forced to disgurgitate his five swallowed children. Knowing nothing of Rhea's cunning, Titan accused his brother of breaking his word and chased him out of the sky. Zeus, vindictive and very angry at this injustice inflicted on his father, attacked Titan and put his father back on the throne. This episode, called Titanomachy or the war of the giants, first opposed Zeus, alone, to Titan and his brothers. Then, Cronos, having understood that the son will succeed the father no matter what, as life will always follow death, sided with Titan in order to counter fate. Zeus, armed with lightning and thunder, surrounded himself with his brothers and sisters, returned to life, and won the war against the Titans. They were also helped by Prometheus, the son of the Titan Japet, who rallied around the new generation of powerful. So the new order took over the old. The law dethroned chaos. Many wives were attributed to Zeus. It would seem that each of them shed light on the character of their husband. Thus, Métis meant intelligence, Themis and Eurynmé order and beauty, Hera, his official wife, displayed protection and anger. Zeus had four children with the latter, but also many other children out of wedlock. ", author:"Nassim" },

As a bride, she is also the queen of heaven and the gods - the female deity of heaven who shares certain characteristics with her husband. However, Hera especially protects women, marriage, family and represents legitimacy - (Juno among the Romans). She is often adorned with a veil symbolizing virginity, a royal scepter and a diadem suggesting the vault of heaven. His animal is the peacock, whose plumage is the symbol of the starry sky. Hera is of the same origin as Zeus. Their common parents are Cronos and Rhea, respectively the Time of creation and the Earth. Hera was raised by the Titan Ocean and the Titanide Thetys, the sea goddess. Zeus and Hera met in the region of the Hesperides, where the waves of ambrosia flowed - the source of eternal life. Their meeting dates before their accession as rulers of the world. The marriage, on the other hand, was celebrated after they imposed the new reign on Olympus. The formalization of their sacred union would have taken place in spring, the time of fertility and the rebirth of nature. Hera often wears flower crowns, symbols of this eternal renewal. Hera is characterized by great beauty according to Greek canons: her face is adorned with large 'bovine' eyes and a dazzling white complexion. However, she displays a serious air. Protector of morals through fidelity in marriage, she is capable of great anger whenever she learns of a new infidelity from Zeus. These anger are often associated with the storms of autumn which symbolize the marital disputes between the spouses. The divine couple had four children: Ares, Hébé, Ilythia and Héphaïstos. But, during one of her great anger against Zeus, Hera alone gave birth to Typhaon in the blast of a hurricane, thus rivaling the lightning and thunder of Zeus. She also raised many children of Zeus, born out of wedlock. Ilythia, the daughter of Hera and Zeus did not inherit the irascible character of her parents. On the other hand, she perpetuates the protection of women as the goddess of motherhood. The cult of Hera was born in Argos, the city which has dedicated many festivals and legends to it. However, the island of Samos disputes Argos for the cradle of the cult of Hera.", author:"Anis" },

He is celebrated as the protective God of music and poetry, the healing God too, but above all as the God of light, truth and harmony. Symbolically, Apollo is a positive divinity who favors understanding between men and Gods. He can also take on the aspect of a punitive force with his bow and arrows. Its symbol is the laurel as a victory over the darkness of winter, the protective dolphin of maritime expeditions that begin with sunny days, and the crow as the bird of prophecies. He is often depicted on a white swan or a griffin, protectors of light. Apollo, born on the island of Delos, is the son of Zeus and Leto. His mother, one of Zeus' many companions, was jealous of Hera. Therefore, she was looking for a place to give birth to her child, hiding from the wrath of Zeus' rightful wife. Thus, she landed on Delos, an infertile island, where she gave birth to her twins Artemis and Apollo. At the birth of Apollo, the island of Delos was covered with a golden light. The God of light stayed there in the summer and left again in the winter. It was associated with the benefits of the Sun, represented by ripe fruits; on the other hand, its evil aspect was represented by the fruits dried in the sun, visible at the end of the summer. At the foot of Parnassus, in Delphi, considered by the Greeks as the center of the world, the oracle of Apollo was celebrated. The oracle was pronounced by the Pythias who bore this name in memory of Apollo's victory over Python, the serpent of darkness. Hence the other names of Apollo: Délien or Pythien. As a God of light, he was also associated with the Sun, hence his name Phébus meaning 'the one who shines'. However, he was not confused with the God Helios, the true Sun God. The image of Apollo was that of a tall young man, dazzlingly beautiful, with hair long as the rays of the sun. It is the Sun which gave him the power of the healer and this power, he had transmitted it to his son, Asclepius (Aesculapius). It healed the body as well as the soul, thanks to its purifying power and its role of conciliator between humans and the Gods.", author:"Gabriel" },

Daughter of Zeus and Métis, goddess of wisdom, protector of the city, families, heroes, hygiene, civilized life, crafts and agriculture. Its attributes are the olive tree, the helmet and the spear. Athena is also a warrior goddess but not hawkish. She fights external enemies. However, it is as the goddess of wisdom that she has come to prominence through the centuries and symbolizes Greek civilization. Several legends trace the origins of Athena: Ouranos would have warned Zeus that a child of Métis would succeed in dethroning him. As soon as she was pregnant, Zeus decided to swallow her to counter fate. A few months later, he began to have terrible headaches and he asked Hephaestus, his son and god of the forge, to split his head with an ax, to free him from this great pain. Thus springs Athena, adorned with a spear and a shield. Some sources consider that she was born of Zeus alone. Still others suggest that Athena is the personification of lightning. Zeus would have struck a cloud and this violent blow to the head would have made his daughter come out of this cloud. Athena is Zeus' favorite child and as such she is authorized to wear the aegis, shield and lightning. Like Hestia and Artemis, Athena is a virgin goddess. She fights alongside her father during the titanomachy. She teaches the gods the strategy of defense, advises them and guides them throughout the battles. Some sources claim that she killed the Giant Pallas, hence the name Pallas Athena. Others suggest that Pallas would come from “pallô”, brandishing arms, as the young goddess did when she was born, or even from “palax” meaning young girl. Athena's advice generally provides rules of conduct whatever the place, the relationship between people or the situation. Moreover, as the protector of heroes such as Diomedes, Perseus, Achilles, Telemachus… she appears in the guise of Mentor. She also helps Hercules to accomplish his 12 labors. During the Trojan War, she came to the aid of the Greek army. Athena also has a civilizing role through the teaching of construction techniques and agriculture that she lavishes on the population. The Parthenon is its temple whose name comes from the word 'parthenos' designating the virgin.

He is also considered an earthly god because he was associated with the phenomenon of earthquakes and volcanic eruption. The Greeks believed that it was Poseidon who lifted the Earth and carried it on his shoulders, as Atlas carried the sky. Its attributes are the trident or the three-branched scepter, the dolphin, the horse, the bull. The image of the horse and the bull come from the Greek poets who symbolized the big waves in the open sea by the horses standing on their hind legs or the fury of the bulls. The dolphin, on the contrary, symbolized the calm sea. Its appearance was the forerunner of safe navigation. Its season is winter. Among the Ionians, the stormiest month at sea was called 'poseidon', denoting December and January. Bearded, with long curly hair, he is often depicted seated on a throne. Son of Cronos and Rhea, he is one of the divinities of natural phenomena. Poseidon is brother of Zeus and Hades. He crisscrosses the people in his tank pulled by the Nereids. The characteristics of this deity are very closely linked to the geographical location of Greece with its long coastlines and volcanoes. Poseidon joins forces with Zeus to dethrone Cronos, his father. Then, he allied with Apollo to overthrow Zeus, but without success. As punishment, Zeus dispossessed them of their divine attributes for a year and exiled them. Poseidon had a large number of descendants: Pegasus and Chrysaor, Pelias and Nélée, Eole, Cycnos, Polyphemus - the cyclops, Triton… Poseidon's natural power protects naval commerce. The Greeks associate their wealth and their domination in the Mediterranean with the powers of Poseidon.

Ares is the son of Zeus, god of thunder, and of Hera, goddess known for her irritable temper. Both of her parents symbolize atmospheric changes and the fury of nature. Zeus and Hera hated their son who had only rare appearances in Greek mythology. The people of ancient Greece did not appreciate this brawling gods. No city had chosen him as its protector and he was often defeated by deities with positive powers. Thus Athena, the positive goddess of war because carrying victory, always stood up as the sworn enemy of Arès, cruel and bloody god. Among the Romans, on the other hand, he was celebrated and honored as the god of glory. Ares often fought with Eris, his sister, the goddess of Discord and Struggle, with Enyo, the goddess who symbolized the cry of war, then with her two sons Deimos and Phobos, meaning Terror and Fear. He was the lover of Aphrodite which earned him the courage of Hephaestus, her husband. His children are mortal: Phlegias, Diomedes, Cyonos who represent meteorological phenomena.

He is often depicted as lame, sturdy and bearded wearing an oval cap and short tunic. Its attributes are the hammer and pincers. The origin of Hephaestus varies according to the sources. Some report that he is the son of Zeus and Hera. Others than Hera would have given birth to her alone, on a day of discord with her husband. When he is born, the child is so ugly that his mother, Hera, throws him from Olympus. From this fall he becomes crippled, hence his image of a lame god. Other sources claim that he is disabled from birth and that is why his mother rejected him. After his fall, he would be taken in by Thétis and Eurynomè, at the bottom of the ocean, where he spent nine years forging fine works. Later, he moved his forge to the island of Lemnos, whose volcano was still active. He is a skilled blacksmith. Among his works are the chariot of Helios, the golden breastplate of Heracles and Diomedes, the armor of Achilles, the scepter of Zeus and his golden throne and the entire palace of Olympus. Hephaestus taught men the art of metallurgy. He therefore appears as an educator of men by offering them the first instruments of civilization. He creates, by order of Zeus, the first woman, Pandora, from clay, giving her the human voice and the vital breath. Hephaestus had sons on the island of Lemnos, named Cabires, the spirits of underground fire, the hidden spirit of the deities. He is credited with three wives: Aphrodite, Charis and Aglaïé.

Dionysus is named after the god of Nysa because the nymphs of the mountain Nysa would have been his nurses. The nymphs are, moreover, deities of the damp earth, necessary for the ripening of the vine. The attribute of Dionysus is the wreath of ivy and laurel, placed on a long curly hair. According to Theban legend, Dionysus is the son of Semele and Zeus. Jealous, Hera sowed doubt in Semele who was pregnant with Zeus, saying that if he really loved her, he had to show all his celestial power. Semele demanded this proof of love and forced Zeus to come to his home, pouring out all the power of lightning and thunder. Semele died in laziness, but Zeus took the embryo and hid it in his thigh in order to protect it from Hera. When the time for the birth came, he released his son. According to other sources, it is the child resulting from the incest between Zeus and Rhea. As an adult, he tastes the fruit that grew in the cave of Nysa where he was raised. He offers this sweet drink to his friends, the geniuses of the forest - the Nymphs, the Maenads, the Satyrs and the Silenus - and leads them into intoxicated joys. This is the reason why he is also called Bromios, the loud god. The Maenads at his side organized orgiastic feasts, in his name, to the glory of fertile nature. The deities of the forest are very important in the worship of Dionysus. They awaken the wilderness by inviting humans to deviate from established principles.

Protector of loves and lovers; she weaves amorous intrigues between gods and mortals - (Venus among the Romans). Its symbols are: the myrtle, the apple, the swan, the sparrow, the dove and the dolphin. It is believed that his cult was born in Assyria, that it was transported to Phenicia (goddess Astarte), then from Phenicia to Cyprus, to finish in Laconia and the Peloponnese. His cult in Greece was mostly linked to island and coastal regions. She was one of the deities who presided over the birth of life, as the goddess of love and fertility. His armed representation probably comes from his Asian origins, hence his attachment to the Greek god Ares who thus completes his powers among the Greeks. The introduction of the figure of Aphrodite into the Greek pantheon changes the previously austere, virginal or maternal feminine image of the goddesses (Athena, Artemis, Hera, Demeter…). Aphrodite then brings the image of pleasure and loses the link with the nascent nature. Aphrodite Ourania is an older figure of this divinity, personifying marriage, family, fertility; it is opposed to Aphrodite Pandèmos, more recent, which reigns only on the union of the sexes and the desire. In archaic mythology, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione (consort of Zeus and sometimes goddess of agrarian life). At a later time, its birth is attributed to the foam of the seas. During the duel between Ouranos and his son Cronos, the latter injured his father by cutting his genitals which fell into the sea. It is from this sperm of Ouranos that Aphrodite was born. It was then that Zephyr would have transported her to the shores of Cyprus, just after her birth in Kythera, a Phoenician counter. This is the justification for its other names: Cytherea and Kypris. Aphrodite was the wife of Hephaestus, but she also succumbed to the charm of Ares with whom she had four children: Eros, Deimos (terror), Phobos (fear) and Harmony. His sanctuary is in Paphos.

She is one of the founding gods of Olympus. His image is sometimes related to Rhea or Gaïa who also symbolize the earth. Unlike these two older deities, Demeter represents plowed land, seed buried in the ground as well as the world of darkness and death.

This god was so severe, and his kingdom so sad, that no woman consented to share his crown; so that he was obliged to kidnap Persephone, daughter of Demeter. He was also hated and feared, along with all the hellish gods, because he was believed to be inflexible. So no temple or altar was erected for him, and no hymns were composed in his honor. The Romans had put him not only among the great gods, but among the 8 chosen gods, the only ones that were allowed to be represented in gold, silver, ivory.

    { id: 21, name: 'Cronus', type:"Titan", title: 'Once Ruler of the World, Father of Zeus', imageUrl:"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a3/86/29/a3862963c622b8851ab05191f1ffa206.jpg" , description: "Cronus was the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the leader of the first generation of Titans, and, for a brief period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child – Zeus – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in Tartarus. Cronus was the son of Uranus and Gaea, the youngest one of the original Twelve Titans. This makes him the brother of five male siblings (Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Crius, and Iapetus) and six Titanides (Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Themis, and Rhea). Cronus eventually married his sister Rhea, with whom he fathered six children: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. According to an isolated tale, Cronus was also the father of the centaur Chiron, whom he begot after transforming himself into a mare to mislead the jealous Rhea and secretly mating with Philyra, the daughter of Oceanus. The story of Cronus begins with the irrational hate-driven decision of his father Uranus (the Sky) to not allow his children (the Cyclopes, the Hecatoncheires, and the Titans) to leave their mother’s womb, i.e., the Earth. Grief-stricken and straitened, Gaea devised a crafty little plan, fashioned an adamantine sickle (harpe) and appealed to her offspring for help. “My children,” she said, “if you obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father.” Cronus was the only one not seized by fear. So, Gaea gave Cronus the sickle and hid him strategically in her womb. The very next night, when the love-longing Uranus came to lie with Gaea, Cronus stretched forth his hand and castrated him. Afterward, he released his brothers and his sisters and, buoyant and prideful, he proclaimed himself the king of all gods and men. After seizing power, Cronus married his sister Rhea and, for a while, everything seemed all but perfect. Finally freed from her burdens, Gaea was once again blissful and more than generous, producing crops for all human beings of her own accord. Untroubled by toils and hard work, the humans lived carefree and healthy lives, which ended peacefully and only when they were very old. Some say that even the gods themselves walked among the humans during the reign of Cronus. Undoubtedly, this was the Golden Age, the most beautiful of the fabled five ages of man. However, at some point, Cronus violently and dramatically changed his ways. Fearing rebellion, he imprisoned both the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires in Tartarus and set the dragoness Campe to guard them. Alarmed by a prophecy saying that he would be overthrown by one of his children, he started swallowing them all, one by one. Seeing that her husband has, in essence, transformed into Uranus, after being impregnated with her sixth child, Rhea turned to Gaea for help. Gaea counseled her daughter to go to Crete, where eventually the Titaness gave birth to a mighty son, Zeus. Prompted by further advice, Rhea left her child there and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in place of the supposed baby. Cronus swallowed the stone, unsuspecting of any foul play, and unaware that nymphs are meanwhile raising his eventual overthrower in Crete. When the time came, disguised as Cronus’ cupbearer, Zeus managed to slip his father a vomit-inducing drink (prepared by Metis) in place of his favorite wine. This led to Cronus disgorging all of his children, who subsequently teamed up with the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires and ousted him from power after a bloody, decade-long war remembered forevermore as the Titanomachy. Deposed from the throne, Cronus either escaped to Latium (modern Lazio) or was imprisoned in Tartarus with the rest of the Titans. Either way, he seems to have reverted to his good old ways, since, in time, he was promoted to be the ruler of the Islands of the Blessed, a heaven-like abode, where the souls of only the greatest heroes lived after their earthly deaths.

    { id: 22, name: 'Gaia', type:"Titan",title: 'Mother of Everything', imageUrl:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/90/e2/ba/90e2baf365b64b7abed10a2e04441684.jpg",description: "Gaea was the Ancient Greek personification of the Earth, and, for all intents and purposes, the Mother of Everything Beautiful in the world. Born spontaneously – either out of Nothingness or out of Chaos – Gaea brought forth (among others) Uranus, with whom she subsequently mated to give birth to the Titans, themselves parents of most of the Olympians. Gaea rebelled against the reigns of all three rulers of the universe (Uranus, Cronus, Zeus), but, ultimately, she had to accept her grandson Zeus as the supreme king of all gods and men. Gaea (the Earth), “the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus,” was the first deity to be born after Chaos, the gaping emptiness, came into being. She was followed by Tartarus (the Underworld) and Eros (Love). Some believe that these three were, in fact, all children of the dark primeval void, but, most probably, they belonged to the same – the very first – generation of gods. Without a mate, Gaea brought forth three children: Uranus (the Sky), Ourea (the Mountains), and Pontus (the Sea). First, she lay with her oldest son, Uranus, and gave birth to eighteen children. The first twelve of them were the Titans: six females (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys), and six males (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus). Next, she bore the three Cyclopes (Brontes, Steropes, and Arges), and, finally, the three Hecatoncheires (Cottus, Briareos, and Gyges). Afterward, Gaea mated with Pontus and brought into being five more children: Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. Though lustful and unrestrained, Uranus, the Sky, hated his children; so much so, in fact, that he pushed each of them back into the Earth (the womb of their mother) at the very moment of birth. After a while, devastated by grief and pain, Gaea fashioned an adamantine sickle and asked her children to help her oust Uranus from power. Cronus – who despised his father – was the only one who wasn’t afraid to agree to her plan and, following Gaea’s advice, he hid at a different place in her womb and lay there in waiting for a chance to attack Uranus. The chance came the very same night when Uranus tried sleeping with Gaea yet again. Cronus stretched forth his hand and hacked off his father’s genitals. Afterward, he freed his brothers and his sisters and became the new king of the gods. The blood which spurted out of Uranus’ wound sprinkled Gaea and impregnated her with many more children: the three Erinnyes (or Fates), the numerous Gigantes (or Giants) and the even more numerous Meliads (the Nymphs of the Ash Trees). After a brief period of harmony and bliss, Cronus started ruling the world the same way his father had ruled it before him: brutally and autocratically. Alarmed by a prophecy and fearing a rebellion, he imprisoned his brothers, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, in Tartarus, and swallowed all but the youngest of his six children. The child – who will grow to become Zeus – was saved thanks to the shrewd advice which Gaea gave to Rhea, Cronus’ wife: to replace it with a stone. However, even after successfully freeing his brothers and his sisters, Zeus was unable to overthrow Cronus – at least not until Gaea advised him to free the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires from Tartarus and form an alliance with them. This did the trick: after ten years, the Olympians finally won the war against the Titans (the Titanomachy), and Zeus became the third ruler of the gods. Zeus’ supreme power was challenged several times; the most serious two of these challenges were orchestrated by his grandmother, Gaea. Even at his tyrannical worst, Zeus was a far better ruler than his predecessors; however, this mattered not in the slightest to Gaea, since Zeus too dared to imprison some of her children. In his case, naturally, the prisoners were the Titans, left to rot away in Tartarus. Consequently, Gaea summoned the best of the rest, the Gigantes, and commanded them to get rid of Zeus. That’s how the Gigantomachy started, a war which lasted for a long period, but which, nevertheless, ended with the Olympians prevailing and Zeus cementing his power. The defeat enraged Gaea. Angered, she mated with her brother, Tartarus, and gave birth to one of the most fearsome creatures in all of Greek mythology: the fire-breathing dragon Typhoeus, the father of all monsters. Typhoeus was such a formidable opponent that he managed to singlehandedly fight off almost all Olympians (including Zeus), before Zeus’ lightning bolts finally overwhelmed him. After Typhoeus’ demise, Gaea conceded defeat and accepted Zeus as the supreme leader of all gods. To prove her allegiance, she warned her grandson that the child his first wife (Metis) was pregnant with, was destined to overthrow him. Years later, Gaea attended Zeus’ wedding with his seventh – and final – wife, Hera, and gifted the Queen of Olympus the golden apples of the Hesperides. ", author:"Anis" },

He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against Zeus, and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the Titanomachy: he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by Heracles. Perseus, probably using Medusa’s head, turned him into the stony Atlas Mountains. Atlas’ name is of unsure – probably pre-Greek – origin, but the Ancient Greeks and Romans seem to have thought it had been derived from a similar-sounding Greek root with the meaning of “very enduring.” This fully coincides with Atlas’ portrayal as an enormous, bearded man, always slightly bent and in pain under the weight of the heavens, usually represented as a globe sketched with the most famous constellations. According to Hesiod, Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene. However, some – disagreeing with him – say that his mother was another sea nymph named Asia. Either way, he had three brothers (Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius) and possibly as many wives. By Pleione, he had eight daughters: the goddess-nymph Calypso and the seven Pleiades (Alcyone, Asterope, Electra, Caleano, Taygete, Merope and Hermes’ mother, Maia). Another Oceanid, Aethra, bore him few more daughters, the Hyades, and his only son, Hyas. Finally, according to some, the Hesperides were also Atlas’ daughters, out of his marriage with Hesperis. Iapetus’ sons took the opposing sides during the Titanomachy: while Prometheus and Epimetheus decided to help Zeus, Atlas and his brother Menoetius sided with the Titans. In time, Atlas even managed to become the leader of the rebellion, but that didn’t end up too well for him in the long run, since it got him the most severe punishment after the defeat of the Titans. Namely, Atlas was condemned to hold up the heavens for all eternity, standing at the furthest west edges of the earth near the garden of his daughters, the Hesperides. Some say that the sky was placed directly on his shoulders. Others, however, are more merciful, claiming that Atlas actually holds the two pillars which keep the earth and the sky apart.Since, obviously, Atlas wasn’t allowed to move one bit – and not many people knew where his dwelling place was – the only myths he’s in include two of Greek’s greatest heroes reaching him at the end of the earth. Heracles The first of them was Heracles, who, after having two of his original ten labors invalidated, was tasked with bringing Eurystheus few of the Hesperidean golden apples. Heracles smartly offered Atlas to switch roles with him so that the Titan could fetch the apples from his daughters himself, causing no fuss or drawing unnecessary attention from Ladon, the dragon-guardian of the apples. Atlas did just that but had a plan of his own – to deliver the apples himself to Eurystheus and then, of course, forget all about Heracles and his old job. Heracles, however, outsmarted the gullible Titan, agreeing to the plan but asking him to hold for him the sky first so that he could adjust himself in a more comfortable position. Instead, Heracles just seized the golden apples and never looked back. Perseus The second – and last – hero to visit Atlas was Perseus. Passing by the Titan, Perseus asked him for hospitality, but Atlas, fearing some humiliating trick yet again, turned him down. So, Perseus showed him the head of Medusa and Atlas was turned into stone, i.e., the mountain range in North Africa which still bears his name. ", author:"Anis" },
