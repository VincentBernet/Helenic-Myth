    { id: 1, name: 'Zeus', type:"God", title: 'God of Heaven and Master of the World', imageUrl:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Zeus_Otricoli_Pio-Clementino_Inv257.jpg/800px-Zeus_Otricoli_Pio-Clementino_Inv257.jpg" , description: "God of the sky and master of the world, he manifests himself through atmospheric phenomena. Its abode is Ether - the eternal light, found in the upper part of the sky - (Jupiter among the Romans). He reigns over gods and men by restoring justice and order. Iris, the rainbow, is his messenger on Earth. Lightning is his attribute. The eagle is the symbol of his power. Zeus was born from the union of Cronos, god of time and creation, and Rhea, goddess of nature and successive movement. He owes his life to the cunning of his mother, Rhea, who opposed the deal between Cronos and his older brother, Titan. Indeed, Titan had ceded the reins of power to his younger brother Cronos, on condition that the latter never allow his children to succeed him. Thus, Cronos undertook to devour all his offspring in order to keep his rank of supreme God. He successively devoured Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades and Poseidon. Rhea, pregnant again and bruised by the death of her children, decided to save her new child and gave birth to him secretly by taking refuge in Crete, on Mount Diktéo. She entrusted the child to the nymphs, in charge of feeding it, and to the Curetes who danced with noise in front of the cave where the child was so that Cronos did not hear the baby's crying. When she returned to her husband, Rhéa offered him a stone surrounded by linen, which he immediately swallowed. So Zeus survived thanks to his mother's cunning. When Zeus, already grown up, learned the story of his birth, he rebelled against his father Cronos, calling on him to cede power to him. The latter, constrained by the determination of his son, made him his successor. Destroyed, Cronos was forced to disgurgitate his five swallowed children. Knowing nothing of Rhea's cunning, Titan accused his brother of breaking his word and chased him out of the sky. Zeus, vindictive and very angry at this injustice inflicted on his father, attacked Titan and put his father back on the throne. This episode, called Titanomachy or the war of the giants, first opposed Zeus, alone, to Titan and his brothers. Then, Cronos, having understood that the son will succeed the father no matter what, as life will always follow death, sided with Titan in order to counter fate. Zeus, armed with lightning and thunder, surrounded himself with his brothers and sisters, returned to life, and won the war against the Titans. They were also helped by Prometheus, the son of the Titan Japet, who rallied around the new generation of powerful. So the new order took over the old. The law dethroned chaos. Many wives were attributed to Zeus. It would seem that each of them shed light on the character of their husband. Thus, Métis meant intelligence, Themis and Eurynmé order and beauty, Hera, his official wife, displayed protection and anger. Zeus had four children with the latter, but also many other children out of wedlock. ", author:"Nassim" },

As a bride, she is also the queen of heaven and the gods - the female deity of heaven who shares certain characteristics with her husband. However, Hera especially protects women, marriage, family and represents legitimacy - (Juno among the Romans). She is often adorned with a veil symbolizing virginity, a royal scepter and a diadem suggesting the vault of heaven. His animal is the peacock, whose plumage is the symbol of the starry sky. Hera is of the same origin as Zeus. Their common parents are Cronos and Rhea, respectively the Time of creation and the Earth. Hera was raised by the Titan Ocean and the Titanide Thetys, the sea goddess. Zeus and Hera met in the region of the Hesperides, where the waves of ambrosia flowed - the source of eternal life. Their meeting dates before their accession as rulers of the world. The marriage, on the other hand, was celebrated after they imposed the new reign on Olympus. The formalization of their sacred union would have taken place in spring, the time of fertility and the rebirth of nature. Hera often wears flower crowns, symbols of this eternal renewal. Hera is characterized by great beauty according to Greek canons: her face is adorned with large 'bovine' eyes and a dazzling white complexion. However, she displays a serious air. Protector of morals through fidelity in marriage, she is capable of great anger whenever she learns of a new infidelity from Zeus. These anger are often associated with the storms of autumn which symbolize the marital disputes between the spouses. The divine couple had four children: Ares, Hébé, Ilythia and Héphaïstos. But, during one of her great anger against Zeus, Hera alone gave birth to Typhaon in the blast of a hurricane, thus rivaling the lightning and thunder of Zeus. She also raised many children of Zeus, born out of wedlock. Ilythia, the daughter of Hera and Zeus did not inherit the irascible character of her parents. On the other hand, she perpetuates the protection of women as the goddess of motherhood. The cult of Hera was born in Argos, the city which has dedicated many festivals and legends to it. However, the island of Samos disputes Argos for the cradle of the cult of Hera.", author:"Anis" },

He is celebrated as the protective God of music and poetry, the healing God too, but above all as the God of light, truth and harmony. Symbolically, Apollo is a positive divinity who favors understanding between men and Gods. He can also take on the aspect of a punitive force with his bow and arrows. Its symbol is the laurel as a victory over the darkness of winter, the protective dolphin of maritime expeditions that begin with sunny days, and the crow as the bird of prophecies. He is often depicted on a white swan or a griffin, protectors of light. Apollo, born on the island of Delos, is the son of Zeus and Leto. His mother, one of Zeus' many companions, was jealous of Hera. Therefore, she was looking for a place to give birth to her child, hiding from the wrath of Zeus' rightful wife. Thus, she landed on Delos, an infertile island, where she gave birth to her twins Artemis and Apollo. At the birth of Apollo, the island of Delos was covered with a golden light. The God of light stayed there in the summer and left again in the winter. It was associated with the benefits of the Sun, represented by ripe fruits; on the other hand, its evil aspect was represented by the fruits dried in the sun, visible at the end of the summer. At the foot of Parnassus, in Delphi, considered by the Greeks as the center of the world, the oracle of Apollo was celebrated. The oracle was pronounced by the Pythias who bore this name in memory of Apollo's victory over Python, the serpent of darkness. Hence the other names of Apollo: Délien or Pythien. As a God of light, he was also associated with the Sun, hence his name Phébus meaning 'the one who shines'. However, he was not confused with the God Helios, the true Sun God. The image of Apollo was that of a tall young man, dazzlingly beautiful, with hair long as the rays of the sun. It is the Sun which gave him the power of the healer and this power, he had transmitted it to his son, Asclepius (Aesculapius). It healed the body as well as the soul, thanks to its purifying power and its role of conciliator between humans and the Gods.", author:"Gabriel" },

Daughter of Zeus and Métis, goddess of wisdom, protector of the city, families, heroes, hygiene, civilized life, crafts and agriculture. Its attributes are the olive tree, the helmet and the spear. Athena is also a warrior goddess but not hawkish. She fights external enemies. However, it is as the goddess of wisdom that she has come to prominence through the centuries and symbolizes Greek civilization. Several legends trace the origins of Athena: Ouranos would have warned Zeus that a child of Métis would succeed in dethroning him. As soon as she was pregnant, Zeus decided to swallow her to counter fate. A few months later, he began to have terrible headaches and he asked Hephaestus, his son and god of the forge, to split his head with an ax, to free him from this great pain. Thus springs Athena, adorned with a spear and a shield. Some sources consider that she was born of Zeus alone. Still others suggest that Athena is the personification of lightning. Zeus would have struck a cloud and this violent blow to the head would have made his daughter come out of this cloud. Athena is Zeus' favorite child and as such she is authorized to wear the aegis, shield and lightning. Like Hestia and Artemis, Athena is a virgin goddess. She fights alongside her father during the titanomachy. She teaches the gods the strategy of defense, advises them and guides them throughout the battles. Some sources claim that she killed the Giant Pallas, hence the name Pallas Athena. Others suggest that Pallas would come from “pallô”, brandishing arms, as the young goddess did when she was born, or even from “palax” meaning young girl. Athena's advice generally provides rules of conduct whatever the place, the relationship between people or the situation. Moreover, as the protector of heroes such as Diomedes, Perseus, Achilles, Telemachus… she appears in the guise of Mentor. She also helps Hercules to accomplish his 12 labors. During the Trojan War, she came to the aid of the Greek army. Athena also has a civilizing role through the teaching of construction techniques and agriculture that she lavishes on the population. The Parthenon is its temple whose name comes from the word 'parthenos' designating the virgin.

He is also considered an earthly god because he was associated with the phenomenon of earthquakes and volcanic eruption. The Greeks believed that it was Poseidon who lifted the Earth and carried it on his shoulders, as Atlas carried the sky. Its attributes are the trident or the three-branched scepter, the dolphin, the horse, the bull. The image of the horse and the bull come from the Greek poets who symbolized the big waves in the open sea by the horses standing on their hind legs or the fury of the bulls. The dolphin, on the contrary, symbolized the calm sea. Its appearance was the forerunner of safe navigation. Its season is winter. Among the Ionians, the stormiest month at sea was called 'poseidon', denoting December and January. Bearded, with long curly hair, he is often depicted seated on a throne. Son of Cronos and Rhea, he is one of the divinities of natural phenomena. Poseidon is brother of Zeus and Hades. He crisscrosses the people in his tank pulled by the Nereids. The characteristics of this deity are very closely linked to the geographical location of Greece with its long coastlines and volcanoes. Poseidon joins forces with Zeus to dethrone Cronos, his father. Then, he allied with Apollo to overthrow Zeus, but without success. As punishment, Zeus dispossessed them of their divine attributes for a year and exiled them. Poseidon had a large number of descendants: Pegasus and Chrysaor, Pelias and Nélée, Eole, Cycnos, Polyphemus - the cyclops, Triton… Poseidon's natural power protects naval commerce. The Greeks associate their wealth and their domination in the Mediterranean with the powers of Poseidon.

Some report that he is the son of Zeus and Hera. Others than Hera would have given birth to her alone, on a day of discord with her husband. When he is born, the child is so ugly that his mother, Hera, throws him from Olympus. From this fall he becomes crippled, hence his image of a lame god. Other sources claim that he is disabled from birth and that is why his mother rejected him. After his fall, he would be taken in by Thétis and Eurynomè, at the bottom of the ocean, where he spent nine years forging fine works. Later, he moved his forge to the island of Lemnos, whose volcano was still active. He is a skilled blacksmith.

Dionysus is named after the god of Nysa because the nymphs of the mountain Nysa would have been his nurses. The nymphs are, moreover, deities of the damp earth, necessary for the ripening of the vine. The attribute of Dionysus is the wreath of ivy and laurel, placed on a long curly hair. According to Theban legend, Dionysus is the son of Semele and Zeus. Jealous, Hera sowed doubt in Semele who was pregnant with Zeus, saying that if he really loved her, he had to show all his celestial power. Semele demanded this proof of love and forced Zeus to come to his home, pouring out all the power of lightning and thunder. Semele died in laziness, but Zeus took the embryo and hid it in his thigh in order to protect it from Hera. When the time for the birth came, he released his son. According to other sources, it is the child resulting from the incest between Zeus and Rhea. As an adult, he tastes the fruit that grew in the cave of Nysa where he was raised. He offers this sweet drink to his friends, the geniuses of the forest - the Nymphs, the Maenads, the Satyrs and the Silenus - and leads them into intoxicated joys. This is the reason why he is also called Bromios, the loud god. The Maenads at his side organized orgiastic feasts, in his name, to the glory of fertile nature. The deities of the forest are very important in the worship of Dionysus. They awaken the wilderness by inviting humans to deviate from established principles.

Protector of loves and lovers; she weaves amorous intrigues between gods and mortals - (Venus among the Romans). Its symbols are: the myrtle, the apple, the swan, the sparrow, the dove and the dolphin. It is believed that his cult was born in Assyria, that it was transported to Phenicia (goddess Astarte), then from Phenicia to Cyprus, to finish in Laconia and the Peloponnese. His cult in Greece was mostly linked to island and coastal regions. She was one of the deities who presided over the birth of life, as the goddess of love and fertility. His armed representation probably comes from his Asian origins, hence his attachment to the Greek god Ares who thus completes his powers among the Greeks. The introduction of the figure of Aphrodite into the Greek pantheon changes the previously austere, virginal or maternal feminine image of the goddesses (Athena, Artemis, Hera, Demeter…). Aphrodite then brings the image of pleasure and loses the link with the nascent nature. Aphrodite Ourania is an older figure of this divinity, personifying marriage, family, fertility; it is opposed to Aphrodite Pandèmos, more recent, which reigns only on the union of the sexes and the desire. In archaic mythology, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione (consort of Zeus and sometimes goddess of agrarian life). At a later time, its birth is attributed to the foam of the seas. During the duel between Ouranos and his son Cronos, the latter injured his father by cutting his genitals which fell into the sea. It is from this sperm of Ouranos that Aphrodite was born. It was then that Zephyr would have transported her to the shores of Cyprus, just after her birth in Kythera, a Phoenician counter. This is the justification for its other names: Cytherea and Kypris. Aphrodite was the wife of Hephaestus, but she also succumbed to the charm of Ares with whom she had four children: Eros, Deimos (terror), Phobos (fear) and Harmony. His sanctuary is in Paphos.

His descent was multiple: of the sons, Autolycos says the night thief and who makes invisible everything he touches; Pan, the forest man; the Satyrs with the nymph Arémosyne; Hermaphrodite, the bisexual divinity born from his union with Aphrodite ... Many wives were attributed to him: Hersé, the morning dew; Peithô, the goddess of Persuasion; Calypso, the famous nymph ... Hermès is at the origin of the sacrificial myths which took place in the morning. At sunrise, the star of the day was thus greeted by the sacrificial fires which ascended to the heavens. These two elements, together, celebrated the communication of which Hermès became the guardian. These twilight rites, preceding dawn and with it the arrival of the gods, earned Hermes the role of messenger of the gods.",    author:"Vincent" },

As such, never living on Mount Olympus, he is not always ranked in the name of the Olympian deities, this although he is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, the 3rd son of Cronos and Rhea - (Pluto among the Romans). He had been devoured by Cronos, just like Poseidon, but Zeus, who was saved by his mother, made Cronos drink a drink and the latter was forced to reject from his womb those he had swallowed. This is how Hades was born again; so he forgot nothing to assist his brother, and make him triumph over the terrible war between the gods and the Titans. After the victory, Hades shared the region of the underworld. This god was so severe, and his kingdom so sad, that no woman consented to share his crown; so that he was obliged to kidnap Persephone, daughter of Demeter. He was also hated and feared, along with all the hellish gods, because he was believed to be inflexible. So no temple or altar was erected for him, and no hymns were composed in his honor. The Romans had put him not only among the great gods, but among the 8 chosen gods, the only ones that were allowed to be represented in gold, silver, ivory. Hades is usually represented kidnapping Persephone, and carrying her, unconscious of terror, on the chariot which is to lead her to his kingdom. He is almost always given a thick beard and a stern demeanor. Often he wears a helmet on his head. It was a present from the Cyclops, whose property was to make it invisible; and it was especially when he wore this armor that he was nicknamed Orcus, the Dark One. He often appears to be seated on his ebony or sulfur throne, sometimes holding a scepter in his right hand, sometimes keys, to express that the doors of life are closed without return to those who come into his empire. Often we see him in a chariot of ancient form, drawn by 4 black and fiery horses. One of the attributes we see most often around him is the cypress, whose dark and dismal foliage has always seemed devoted to melancholy and pain. Those who were devoted to him were crowned with it, and the priests of this god always wore clothes strewn with the leaves of this tree. In the number of plants which were consecrated to it, in addition to the narcissus, the capillary and the leaves of the ebony tree, we could still distinguish the satyrion, a plant that the ancients called serapion, because it was placed on the altars of Serapis, the same as Hades.",    author:"Vincent" },

He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrannical as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child – Zeus – would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in Tartarus. Cronus was the son of Uranus and Gaea, the youngest one of the original Twelve Titans. This makes him the brother of five male siblings (Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Crius, and Iapetus) and six Titanides (Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Themis, and Rhea). Cronus eventually married his sister Rhea, with whom he fathered six children: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. According to an isolated tale, Cronus was also the father of the centaur Chiron, whom he begot after transforming himself into a mare to mislead the jealous Rhea and secretly mating with Philyra, the daughter of Oceanus. The story of Cronus begins with the irrational hate-driven decision of his father Uranus (the Sky) to not allow his children (the Cyclopes, the Hecatoncheires, and the Titans) to leave their mother’s womb, i.e., the Earth. Grief-stricken and straitened, Gaea devised a crafty little plan, fashioned an adamantine sickle (harpe) and appealed to her offspring for help. “My children,” she said, “if you obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father.” Cronus was the only one not seized by fear. So, Gaea gave Cronus the sickle and hid him strategically in her womb. The very next night, when the love-longing Uranus came to lie with Gaea, Cronus stretched forth his hand and castrated him. Afterward, he released his brothers and his sisters and, buoyant and prideful, he proclaimed himself the king of all gods and men. After seizing power, Cronus married his sister Rhea and, for a while, everything seemed all but perfect. Finally freed from her burdens, Gaea was once again blissful and more than generous, producing crops for all human beings of her own accord. Untroubled by toils and hard work, the humans lived carefree and healthy lives, which ended peacefully and only when they were very old. Some say that even the gods themselves walked among the humans during the reign of Cronus. Undoubtedly, this was the Golden Age, the most beautiful of the fabled five ages of man. However, at some point, Cronus violently and dramatically changed his ways. Fearing rebellion, he imprisoned both the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires in Tartarus and set the dragoness Campe to guard them. Alarmed by a prophecy saying that he would be overthrown by one of his children, he started swallowing them all, one by one. Seeing that her husband has, in essence, transformed into Uranus, after being impregnated with her sixth child, Rhea turned to Gaea for help. Gaea counseled her daughter to go to Crete, where eventually the Titaness gave birth to a mighty son, Zeus. Prompted by further advice, Rhea left her child there and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes in place of the supposed baby. Cronus swallowed the stone, unsuspecting of any foul play, and unaware that nymphs are meanwhile raising his eventual overthrower in Crete. When the time came, disguised as Cronus’ cupbearer, Zeus managed to slip his father a vomit-inducing drink (prepared by Metis) in place of his favorite wine. This led to Cronus disgorging all of his children, who subsequently teamed up with the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires and ousted him from power after a bloody, decade-long war remembered forevermore as the Titanomachy. Deposed from the throne, Cronus either escaped to Latium (modern Lazio) or was imprisoned in Tartarus with the rest of the Titans. Either way, he seems to have reverted to his good old ways, since, in time, he was promoted to be the ruler of the Islands of the Blessed, a heaven-like abode, where the souls of only the greatest heroes lived after their earthly deaths.

Born spontaneously – either out of Nothingness or out of Chaos – Gaea brought forth (among others) Uranus, with whom she subsequently mated to give birth to the Titans, themselves parents of most of the Olympians. Gaea rebelled against the reigns of all three rulers of the universe (Uranus, Cronus, Zeus), but, ultimately, she had to accept her grandson Zeus as the supreme king of all gods and men. Gaea (the Earth), “the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus,” was the first deity to be born after Chaos, the gaping emptiness, came into being. She was followed by Tartarus (the Underworld) and Eros (Love). Some believe that these three were, in fact, all children of the dark primeval void, but, most probably, they belonged to the same – the very first – generation of gods. Without a mate, Gaea brought forth three children: Uranus (the Sky), Ourea (the Mountains), and Pontus (the Sea). First, she lay with her oldest son, Uranus, and gave birth to eighteen children. The first twelve of them were the Titans: six females (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys), and six males (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus). Next, she bore the three Cyclopes (Brontes, Steropes, and Arges), and, finally, the three Hecatoncheires (Cottus, Briareos, and Gyges). Afterward, Gaea mated with Pontus and brought into being five more children: Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. Though lustful and unrestrained, Uranus, the Sky, hated his children; so much so, in fact, that he pushed each of them back into the Earth (the womb of their mother) at the very moment of birth. After a while, devastated by grief and pain, Gaea fashioned an adamantine sickle and asked her children to help her oust Uranus from power. Cronus – who despised his father – was the only one who wasn’t afraid to agree to her plan and, following Gaea’s advice, he hid at a different place in her womb and lay there in waiting for a chance to attack Uranus. The chance came the very same night when Uranus tried sleeping with Gaea yet again. Cronus stretched forth his hand and hacked off his father’s genitals. Afterward, he freed his brothers and his sisters and became the new king of the gods. The blood which spurted out of Uranus’ wound sprinkled Gaea and impregnated her with many more children: the three Erinnyes (or Fates), the numerous Gigantes (or Giants) and the even more numerous Meliads (the Nymphs of the Ash Trees). After a brief period of harmony and bliss, Cronus started ruling the world the same way his father had ruled it before him: brutally and autocratically. Alarmed by a prophecy and fearing a rebellion, he imprisoned his brothers, the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, in Tartarus, and swallowed all but the youngest of his six children. The child – who will grow to become Zeus – was saved thanks to the shrewd advice which Gaea gave to Rhea, Cronus’ wife: to replace it with a stone. However, even after successfully freeing his brothers and his sisters, Zeus was unable to overthrow Cronus – at least not until Gaea advised him to free the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires from Tartarus and form an alliance with them. This did the trick: after ten years, the Olympians finally won the war against the Titans (the Titanomachy), and Zeus became the third ruler of the gods. Zeus’ supreme power was challenged several times; the most serious two of these challenges were orchestrated by his grandmother, Gaea. Even at his tyrannical worst, Zeus was a far better ruler than his predecessors; however, this mattered not in the slightest to Gaea, since Zeus too dared to imprison some of her children. In his case, naturally, the prisoners were the Titans, left to rot away in Tartarus. Consequently, Gaea summoned the best of the rest, the Gigantes, and commanded them to get rid of Zeus. That’s how the Gigantomachy started, a war which lasted for a long period, but which, nevertheless, ended with the Olympians prevailing and Zeus cementing his power. The defeat enraged Gaea. Angered, she mated with her brother, Tartarus, and gave birth to one of the most fearsome creatures in all of Greek mythology: the fire-breathing dragon Typhoeus, the father of all monsters. Typhoeus was such a formidable opponent that he managed to singlehandedly fight off almost all Olympians (including Zeus), before Zeus’ lightning bolts finally overwhelmed him. After Typhoeus’ demise, Gaea conceded defeat and accepted Zeus as the supreme leader of all gods. To prove her allegiance, she warned her grandson that the child his first wife (Metis) was pregnant with, was destined to overthrow him. Years later, Gaea attended Zeus’ wedding with his seventh – and final – wife, Hera, and gifted the Queen of Olympus the golden apples of the Hesperides. ", author:"Anis" },

He was the leader of the Titan rebellion against Zeus, and he got a fitting punishment after the end of the Titanomachy: he was condemned to eternally hold up the sky. Only once, and for a very brief period, he was bereaved of this burden by Heracles. Perseus, probably using Medusa’s head, turned him into the stony Atlas Mountains. Atlas’ name is of unsure – probably pre-Greek – origin, but the Ancient Greeks and Romans seem to have thought it had been derived from a similar-sounding Greek root with the meaning of “very enduring.” This fully coincides with Atlas’ portrayal as an enormous, bearded man, always slightly bent and in pain under the weight of the heavens, usually represented as a globe sketched with the most famous constellations. According to Hesiod, Atlas was the son of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene. However, some – disagreeing with him – say that his mother was another sea nymph named Asia. Either way, he had three brothers (Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius) and possibly as many wives. By Pleione, he had eight daughters: the goddess-nymph Calypso and the seven Pleiades (Alcyone, Asterope, Electra, Caleano, Taygete, Merope and Hermes’ mother, Maia). Another Oceanid, Aethra, bore him few more daughters, the Hyades, and his only son, Hyas. Finally, according to some, the Hesperides were also Atlas’ daughters, out of his marriage with Hesperis. Iapetus’ sons took the opposing sides during the Titanomachy: while Prometheus and Epimetheus decided to help Zeus, Atlas and his brother Menoetius sided with the Titans. In time, Atlas even managed to become the leader of the rebellion, but that didn’t end up too well for him in the long run, since it got him the most severe punishment after the defeat of the Titans. Namely, Atlas was condemned to hold up the heavens for all eternity, standing at the furthest west edges of the earth near the garden of his daughters, the Hesperides. Some say that the sky was placed directly on his shoulders. Others, however, are more merciful, claiming that Atlas actually holds the two pillars which keep the earth and the sky apart.Since, obviously, Atlas wasn’t allowed to move one bit – and not many people knew where his dwelling place was – the only myths he’s in include two of Greek’s greatest heroes reaching him at the end of the earth. Heracles The first of them was Heracles, who, after having two of his original ten labors invalidated, was tasked with bringing Eurystheus few of the Hesperidean golden apples. Heracles smartly offered Atlas to switch roles with him so that the Titan could fetch the apples from his daughters himself, causing no fuss or drawing unnecessary attention from Ladon, the dragon-guardian of the apples. Atlas did just that but had a plan of his own – to deliver the apples himself to Eurystheus and then, of course, forget all about Heracles and his old job. Heracles, however, outsmarted the gullible Titan, agreeing to the plan but asking him to hold for him the sky first so that he could adjust himself in a more comfortable position. Instead, Heracles just seized the golden apples and never looked back. Perseus The second – and last – hero to visit Atlas was Perseus. Passing by the Titan, Perseus asked him for hospitality, but Atlas, fearing some humiliating trick yet again, turned him down. So, Perseus showed him the head of Medusa and Atlas was turned into stone, i.e., the mountain range in North Africa which still bears his name. ", author:"Anis" },

It is a classic story of betrayal and vengeance and like many Greek myths has a tragic ending. It begins when Jason's Uncle Pelias kills Jason's father, the Greek King of Iolkos, and takes his throne. Jason's mother brings him to Cheiron, a centaur (half man, half horse) who hides him away and raises him on the Mountain of Pelion. When Jason turns 20, he journeys to see Pelias to reclaim his throne. At a nearby river, Hera the Queen of the Gods approaches him disguised as an old woman. While carrying her across the river he loses a sandal and arrives at court wearing only one. Pelias is nervous when he sees Jason missing a sandal, for an oracle has prophesied that a man wearing only one sandal shall usurp his throne. Watch the VideoJason demands the return of his rightful throne. Pelias replies that Jason should first accomplish a difficult task to prove his worth. The task is for Jason to retrieve the Golden Fleece, kept beyond the edge of the known world in a land called Colchis (modern-day Georgia in Southwest Asia). The story of the fleece is an interesting tale in itself. Zeus, the King of the Gods, had given a golden ram to Jason's ancestor Phrixus. Phrixus later flew on the golden ram from Greece to Colchis, whose king was Aietes, the son of Helios the Sun God. Aietes sacrificed the ram and hung the fleece in a sacred grove guarded by a dragon, as an oracle had foretold that Aietes would lose his kingdom if he lost the fleece. Determined to reclaim his throne, Jason agrees to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Jason assembles a team of great heroes for his crew and they sail aboard the Argo. The first stop of the Argonauts is the Greek Isle of Lemnos, populated only by women. Unknown to Jason and his crew, the women have murdered their husbands. The Argonauts fare much better though; in fact the women use the occasion as an opportunity to repopulate the island. After many more adventures, the Argo passes Constantinople, heading for the Straits of Bosphorus. The Straits of Bosphorus are a narrow passageway of water between the Sea of Marmara, the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. To the ancient Greeks, this was the edge of the known world. The Straits are extremely dangerous due to the currents created by the flow of water from the Black Sea. The ancient Greeks believed that clashing rocks guarded the straits and that the rocks would close together and smash any ship sailing through. Jason had been told by a blind prophet he assisted how to fool the rocks. He was to send a bird ahead of him. The rocks would crash in on it and then reopen, at which point he could successfully sail through. When Jason finally arrives in Colchis he asks King Aietes to return the golden fleece to him as it belonged to his ancestor. Reluctant, the king suggests yet another series of challenges to Jason. He must yoke fire-breathing bulls, plough and sow a field with dragons' teeth and then overcome the warriors who will rise from the furrows. Aietes is confident the tasks are impossible but unbeknownst to the king, his daughter Medea has taken a liking to Jason. She offers to assist Jason if he will marry her. He agrees. Medea is a powerful sorceress and Jason is successful. Jason and Medea return to Greece where Jason claims his father's throne, but their success is short-lived. Uncomfortable with Medea's magic, the locals drive Medea and Jason out of Iolkos. They go into exile in Corinth where the king offers Jason his daughter in marriage. He agrees and so violates his vow to the gods to be true only to Medea. Furious, Medea kills the woman, kills Medea and Jason's children and then ascends to Mount Olympus where she eventually marries Achilles. Jason goes back to Iolkos where his boat the Argo is on display. One day, while he sits next to the boat weeping, the decaying beam of his ship the Argo falls off and hits him on the head, killing him outright.", author:"Vincent" },

Fearing that this prophecy would come true, he locks his only daughter, Danae, into an underground bronze chamber, to keep her away from all men. However, Zeus the all mighty saw the girl and fell in love with her. He then took the form of a golden rain to get into the bronze chamber and seduce Danae. From this union, Danae gave birth to a son whom she named Perseus. When king Acrisius heard the baby crying and realized he had a grandson, his first thought was to kill the unfortunate boy and his mother. But he couldn't do as he feared he would cause the anger of Zeus. So he cast his daughter and grandson into a wooden chest and set them into the wild sea to get drowned. However, Zeus saw the desperate woman and asked Poseidon to calm the sea water. Indeed, the sea calmed down and after a few days, Danae and his new-born son landed on the island of Serifos. There Dictys, a fisherman and brother of the island's king, found them and took them to his home, where they would be safe. Perseus grew up into a fine young man under the care of the kind fisherman Dictys. In the meanwhile, King Polydectes began to be inflamed by passion for Danae, who was still a charming lady although many years had passed since her youth. Danae, however, did not wish this marriage. Polydectes thought that the presence of Perseus was an obstacle for Danae and that is why she didn’t wish to get married. So he decided to set up a plan to get rid of this annoying youth. He challenged Perseus to dare a difficult task, to kill the fearsome Gorgon Medusa and bring back her head. Gorgon Medousa was a terrible monster with snakes in her head and she could turn into stone everyone that looked her face. By killing Medousa, Perseus would prove his braveness, as fits to the son of Zeus. Polydectes was sure that Perseus would not survive this dangerous task. Killing Medusa What Polydectes had not known was that Perseus was beloved by the gods. To help him, god Hermes gave him a curved sword and a pair of winged sandals (other versions of the myth say that Hermes did not give Perseus a pair of winged sandals but a white winged horse) while Athena gave him a mirror of polished bronze and a cap from Hades that could make invisible anyone who would wear it. With these divine aids, Perseus started his long journey to the cave of Medousa, somewhere in Africa. He indeed found lying in her deep cave. Since he was wearing the winged sandals, he could fly around her and since he was wearing the magical cap of Hades, he was invisible. In order to avoid looking Medousa directly to her face and thereby being turned into a stone, Perseus approached Medousa looking at her reflection in the mirror and cut off her head with the sword of Hermes. So easily then, the brave and intelligent Perseus managed to complete this difficult task! Saving Andromeda As he was flying over Africa in his return home, Perseus encountered Atlas the Titan, a mythical giant, who challenged him. In their confrontation, Perseus used Medousa's head to turn the Titan into stone. Perseus continued his journey home and, as he passed the kingdom of Ethiopia, he came upon the beautiful and helpless maiden Andromeda, chained to the rocks waiting to be devoured by a sea monster. The beautiful Andromeda was the daughter of the Ethiopian king Cepheus and queen Cassiopeia. One day, the vain queen had bragged that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, the sea nymphs. The sea nymphs fell angry to hear that and complained to Poseidon, the god of the sea. A furious Poseidon unleashed the sea monster Cetus to frequently ravage the coast and devastate the land of Ethiopia in order to avenge the insult to his wards, the Nereids. The desperate king Cephus appealed Zeus, who suggested the sacrifice of Andromeda as the only way to appease the wrathful Poseidon. Thus it was that our hero Perseus found himself face to face with the beautiful Andromeda chained helplessly onto the rocks, awaiting her doom. Perseus immediately fell in love with the lovely maiden and promptly killed Cetus the beast, who had been licking his lips at the prospect of having a delicious meal. Perseus took Andromeda to her father Cepheus and asked for her hand in marriage. This infuriated Andromeda's uncle Phineus, to whom the maiden was already promised. During the ensuing quarrel, Perseus turned Phineus into a stone by showing him the head of the Gorgon Medousa. Back to Serifos A happily married Perseus returned to the island of Serifos with his wife, Andromeda, only to find Polydectes still pursuing his unwilling mother, Danae. Poor Polydectes soon joined the list of stone statues, thanks to the skillful use of the head of Medousa. After that, Perseus made Dictus the fisherman king of the island, to thank him for his kindness and generosity all these years. A grateful Perseus gave his flying sandal, mirror and magical cap to god Hermes. He also gave his great trophy, the head of Medousa, to goddess Athena. In Argos again The whole family finally decided to leave Seriphos and return to Argos, keeping it a secret from King Acrisius. There, one day, Perseus took part in a sport competition. While throwing the discus, he accidentally struck his grandfather and instantly killed him. The old prophecy had come true, no matter how Acrisius tried to avoid it. After the death of Acrisius, the Kingdom of Argos naturally passed on to Perseus, who thought himself unworthy of it, since he had caused his grandfather's death, even by accident. So he gave away the kingdom of Argos to Megapenthes, in exchange for Megapenthes' kingdom of Tiryns. Perseus and his wife Andromeda happily settled in Tiryns and became the parents of seven sons and one daughter. According to Mythology, the descendants of Perseus ruled Mycenae, the most powerful town of Peloponnese in the Mycenaean times. Another great Greek hero, Heracles, was also a descendant of Perseus while his son Perses is said to have traveled in far away Asia to become the ancestor of a new race, the Persians.", author:"Anis" },

Achilles was the bravest, handsomest, and greatest warrior of the army of Agamemnon in the Trojan War. According to Homer, Achilles was brought up by his mother at Phthia with his inseparable companion Patroclus. Later non-Homeric tales suggest that Patroclus was Achilles’ kinsman or lover. Another non-Homeric episode relates that Thetis dipped Achilles as a child in the waters of the River Styx, by which means he became invulnerable, except for the part of his heel by which she held him—the proverbial “Achilles’ heel.” The later mythographers related that Peleus, having received an oracle that his son would die fighting at Troy, sent Achilles to the court of Lycomedes on Scyros, where he was dressed as a girl and kept among the king’s daughters (one of whom, Deïdamia, bore him Neoptolemus). Hearing from the soothsayer Calchas that Troy could not be taken without Achilles, the Greeks searched for and found him. During the first nine years of the war, Achilles ravaged the country around Troy and took 12 cities. In the 10th year a quarrel with Agamemnon occurred when Achilles insisted that Agamemnon restore Chryseis, his prize of war, to her father, a priest of Apollo, so as to appease the wrath of Apollo, who had decimated the camp with a pestilence. An irate Agamemnon recouped his loss by depriving Achilles of his favourite slave, Briseis. Achilles refused further service, and consequently the Greeks floundered so badly that at last Achilles allowed Patroclus to impersonate him, lending him his chariot and armour. Hector (the eldest son of King Priam of Troy) slew Patroclus, and Achilles, having finally reconciled with Agamemnon, obtained new armour from the god Hephaestus and slew Hector. After dragging Hector’s body behind his chariot, Achilles gave it to Priam at his earnest entreaty. The Iliad concludes with the funeral rites of Hector. It makes no mention of the death of Achilles, though the Odyssey mentions his funeral. The poet Arctinus in his Aethiopis took up the story of the Iliad and related that Achilles, having slain the Ethiopian king Memnon and the Amazon Penthesilea, was himself slain in battle by Priam’s son Paris, whose arrow was guided by Apollo.

    { id: 28, name: 'Ulysses', type:"Hero", title:'Smartest Hero, with also the longest story around him', imageUrl:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Head_Odysseus_MAR_Sperlonga.jpg",description: "Odysseus was a legendary hero in Greek mythology, king of the island of Ithaca and the main protagonist of Homer's epic, the “Odyssey.” The son of Laertes and Anticlea, Odysseus was well known among the Greeks as a most eloquent speaker, an ingenious and cunning trickster. One of the suitors of Helen, Odysseus was obliged to join the Trojan expedition – something he didn’t want to, since he was more than happy alongside his wife, Penelope, and his newborn son, Telemachus, and he knew from a prophecy that if he goes to Troy, it will take him a long time to come back home. So, he tried feigning madness, but Palamedes exposed him, and Odysseus had no choice but to leave. He played a crucial part during the Trojan War – both as a strategist and as a warrior – eventually coming up with the famous stratagem which decided the outcome of the bloody conflict: the Trojan Horse. Afterward, he set sail for Ithaca, but, after blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, he angered Poseidon so much that the sea god did whatever he could to obstruct Odysseus’ journey homeward. After numerous memorable adventures – Circe, the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, the Laestrygonians, Calypso – Odysseus finally managed to reach Ithaca, ten years after leaving Troy and twenty after joining the Trojan expedition. There, he reunited with Telemachus and Penelope and, after killing all of his wife’s Suitors, reclaimed his throne. He died an old man, probably accidentally killed by Telegonus, a child he had fathered with Circe during one of his many adventures. Odysseus Before the Trojan War Family Odysseus was – almost certainly – the only son of Laertes of Ithaca, a former Argonaut, and Anticlea, the only daughter of Autolycus. Now, this Autolycus, Odysseus’ grandfather, was a son of Hermes and was widely renowned as so skillful a thief that he could not be caught, being “able to change whatever he stole into some other form – from white to black, or from black to white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless.” However, later authors didn’t seem too content with a genealogy which makes the cunning Odysseus a relative of a thief only on his mother’s side, so they started spreading a rumor according to which his father wasn’t Laertes, but none other than the master-trickster Sisyphus, who supposedly bargained a night with Anticlea from her father after he had finally caught Autolycus stealing his cattle. Odysseus’ Name Odysseus seems to have spent some of the most defining moments of his childhood with Autolycus, who, in addition to passing on to him his craft, may have even given Odysseus his famous name. “Inasmuch as I am come hither as one that has been angered with many” – supposedly said Autolycus upon being asked to be the godfather, “therefore let the name by which the child is named be Odysseus.” By this etymology, Odysseus comes from odussesthai, “to be wrought against, to be at odds with someone, to hate.” Odysseus’ Scar Many years later, while visiting his grandfather, Odysseus joined his uncles on a boar-hunting trip and, even though he was still an inexperienced adolescent, he managed to kill the boar himself, after coming face to face with it. However, the boar did hurt him, leaving a deep recognizable scar on his leg, one which will play an important part in the memorable drama of his later life. A Suitor of Helen Odysseus was one of the suitors of Helen, step-daughter of King Tyndareus of Sparta. However, he was undoubtedly the most reluctant among them, not only because he was reasonably sure that Menelaus would be the chosen bridegroom, but also because, as beautiful as Helen was, he was much more profoundly smitten by her cousin, Penelope, the daughter of Tyndareus’ brother, Icarius. With or without Odysseus, the suitors were just too many to please, and Tyndareus justifiably feared an outbreak of violence regardless of his final choice. Fortunately, Odysseus thought up an excellent little solution. In exchange for some help from Tyndareus regarding the hand of Penelope, Odysseus advised him to make all the suitors swear an oath that they would respect his final choice and that they would support the husband and wife in any ill fate that the two may face in the future. And so, when Menelaus was chosen, all the other suitors peacefully left Sparta; except for Odysseus, that is, who stayed there until Tyndareus fulfilled his part of the promise and talked his brother into giving Penelope’s hand to Odysseus in marriage. Palamedes’ Ploy After marrying Penelope, Odysseus took her to Ithaca where the couple lived a happy life, made even happier after the birth of their only son, Telemachus. However, while the boy was still a baby, Helen was abducted by Prince Paris of Troy. Calling upon the oath sworn by Helen’s suitors, Menelaus summoned all of them to help him in his quest to bring her back. Ironically – since he had been the one to propose the oath in the first place – Odysseus did not want to join the expedition; and he had a good reason for it: the seer Halitherses had informed him that if he participated, it would take him a long time to return home. So, he decided to feign madness by harnessing a donkey and an ox to a plow and sowing salt on a field. Palamedes – who was the man sent to recruit Odysseus from Ithaca – did not believe the hero one bit; in order to test his sanity, he put Telemachus in front of the plow. Odysseus immediately changed course, thus exposing his plan. Odysseus never forgave Palamedes for this and spend many an hour planning his revenge. Odysseus During the Trojan War It would be an understatement to say that the successful recruitment of Odysseus was a crucial event, one that would eventually decide the outcome of the Trojan War perhaps more than any other: without Odysseus, the Greeks may have never sacked Troy. Recruiting Achilles As a matter of fact, his recruitment started paying dividends even before the Greeks reached Troy. Namely, fearing a prophecy which claimed that Achilles would either live a long and peaceful life or die a glorious death as a mighty warrior, his mother Thetis decided to disguise him as a woman and hide him on the court of King Lycomedes, who ruled with the island of Scyros. Unfortunately, Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that the Greeks could win the Trojan War only if Achilles joined their forces. So, after learning of his whereabouts, he devised a plan to penetrate Achilles’ disguise as well. Masked as a peddler selling women’s clothes, Odysseus laid a spear among his goods, and Achilles (named Pyrrha at the time) was the only one who showed any interest in the shiny object. Some are more inclined to tell a different story, according to which Odysseus feigned an attack on Scyros; in this case, all but Achilles fled upon hearing the sound of the battle horn. Odysseus’ Role in the Trojan War From a discussion between Priam and Helen in Homer’s “Iliad,” we know that Odysseus was shorter by a head than Agamemnon but broader in his chest and shoulders. Physically unimpressive, “thou wouldest have deemed him a churlish man and naught but a fool” on sight, claims Priam. “But whenso he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words fell like snowflakes on a winter's day, then could no mortal man beside vie with Odysseus; then did we not so marvel to behold Odysseus' aspect.” “He knoweth all manner of craft and cunning devices,” concurs Helen, this illustrious “Odysseus of many wiles.” Unsurprisingly, Odysseus’ main role during the Trojan war was one of a crafty strategist and a wise advisor. He was the one most capable of maintaining the morale of the Greeks at a high level, and the one who managed to prevent the bulk of the Greek army from withdrawing from the war after Agamemnon’s plan to test their determination by allowing them a leave had backfired tremendously. Odysseus was also the leader of the three-man expedition sent to appease Achilles who, enraged at what he had perceived as unfair treatment from Agamemnon, decided to leave the battlefield. However, this doesn’t mean that Odysseus didn’t prove his worth as a warrior as well. Together with Diomedes, he captured and killed the Trojan spy Dolon and killed the Thracian king Rhesus during a dangerous night-raid on the Trojan camp. He also captured the Trojan seer Helenus in order to learn from him a few conditions upon whose fulfillment the fall of Troy depended. These included the recruitment of Achilles’ son, Neoptolemus, and the wounded archer, Philoctetes (in whose possession were Heracles’ bow and arrows) – and Odysseus played the central part in both. The Trojan Horse Odysseus’ main and most memorable contribution to the successful conclusion of the Trojan War was the devising of the stratagem by which, after a decade-long war, the Greeks finally managed to enter Troy. It involved the construction of the Trojan Horse, a huge wooden sculpture inside whose hollow belly the greatest of Greece’s celebrated heroes hid. After leaving the Horse near the Gates of Troy, the Greeks pretended to sail away; initially confused, in time, the Trojans started believing that the war was over and that the Horse had been a divine gift; so, they wheeled the sculpture inside their city gates. They spent the whole day joyfully celebrating their victory and dancing around the Horse. However, once the night fell, the Greek warriors hopped out of the sculpture and opened the Gates for the rest of the rest of the Greeks, who, under the guise of the evening, had managed to sail back to the shore. Before long, the Greeks stormed at the unsuspecting, drunk and practically defenseless Trojans, slewing many of them and, finally, winning a famous and conclusive victory. Odysseus’ Cruelty Odysseus was sometimes unreasonably cruel towards his enemies, which is why, as much as he was adored by the Greeks, he was reviled by the Romans (who knew him as Ulysses and considered themselves Trojan descendants). Certainly, Odysseus’ most vicious act happened just after Troy had fallen: fearing some kind of future retribution, he urged for the death of Astyanax, Hector’s little boy. Some even say that it was Odysseus himself who killed Astyanax, possibly throwing the infant from Troy’s walls. In addition, Odysseus never forgot his grudge against Palamedes. According to some authors, he faked a letter from Priam and falsely exposed him as a traitor after which he and Diomedes stoned Palamedes to death. Others claim that the two comrades fooled Palamedes into descending a well under the premise that a treasure laid hidden inside; once Palamedes climbed down the well, Odysseus and Palamedes started throwing rocks at him, eventually burying him at the bottom. The Odyssey: Returning Home to Ithaca After the Trojan War, Odysseus embarked on a ten-year journey to reach his home, Ithaca; his adventures are recounted – mostly in flashbacks – in Homer’s monumental epic “Odyssey.” Chronologically, this is the order in which they happen. Maron and the Cicones Odysseus left Troy with twelve ships – as many as he had sailed with a decade before. Soon after, a strong wind drives the ships off course, and they wind up on the south coast of Thrace, among the Cicones, Trojan allies. In the battle which ensues, Odysseus and his crew kill all the men there, except for a priest of Apollo called Maron. In gratitude, the priest gives Odysseus twelve jars of strong wine. Drunk with victory, the Greeks stay a tad too long in Thrace, giving the Cicones just enough time to summon the necessary reinforcements and eventually prevail, overpowering Odysseus’ crew and killing six men out of each of the twelve ships in the process. The Lotus-Eaters After some time, Odysseus reaches the land of the Lotus-Eaters. He sends three men to scout the area, but, not one of them returns to the ships in due time. As Odysseus finds out, the reason for this is not some cruel act by the Lotus-Eaters, but the taste of their lotus, “so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the Lotus-Eaters without thinking further of their homecoming.” Odysseus has to drag his scouts back to the ships by force, after which the journey to Ithaca goes on. Polyphemus Next, Odysseus' ships reach the island of the Cyclopes, a race of one-eyed giant shepherds famous for their uncouth and violent ways. Enticed by some resources, Odysseus and twelve of his men end up entrapped in the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus, who, after blocking the entrance of the cave with a giant boulder, starts eating them, two by two. The monster manages to devour six of Odysseus’ men before the hero devises a life-saving trick. After introducing himself as Outis – i.e., “Nobody” – he gives Polyphemus some of Maron’s wine and gets him so drunk that he is able to pierce his eye with a stake. “Nobody is killing me by fraud,” cries out Polyphemus, “Nobody is killing me by force!” Though not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed, nobody can blame the other Cyclopes this time around for not running to Polyphemus’ help. The next morning, Odysseus and his six surviving men escape from Polyphemus’ cave by hiding under the bellies of his sheep, as the Cyclops unsuspectingly lets them out to pasture. Before they sail away from the island, however, Odysseus makes the mistake of revealing his true identity to Polyphemus, who then asks his father, the sea-god Poseidon, to avenge him; this will have a major impact on the hero's journey, as it will be Poseidon’s anger which will keep Odysseus away from his beloved Ithaca for the next ten years. Aeolus The ships then reach the island of the god of the winds, Aeolus, who welcomes them warmly and harbors them for a month. At the end of it, so as to aid Odysseus on his journey, Aeolus puts all his winds except for the West Wind in a leather bag and gives the bag to Odysseus. During the next nine days, the West Wind steers the ships gently all the way to Ithaca. However, on the tenth day, just before they reach the shore, Odysseus falls asleep. Thinking it contains gold, his men steal the leather bag and open it, thus releasing all the other winds at once. The ships are violently blown back to the island of Aeolus, where, realizing that Odysseus must be cursed, the god of the winds refuses to help him again. The Laestrygonians Seven days later, Odysseus reaches the island of the Laestrygonians, a tribe of bloodthirsty, man-eating giants. Flinging massive boulders at them and spearing the drowning man like fish, the Laestrygonians sink eleven of Odysseus’ ships and eat most of his sailors; in fact, Odysseus' ship is the only one which manages to escape, the members of its crew the only survivors of this dreadful adventure. Circe Odysseus’ ship next reaches Aeaea, an island ruled by the sorceress Circe. She turns some of Odysseus' men into pigs, but Odysseus, helped by Hermes who gives him a magical herb called moly, resists Circe’s witchcraft and attacks her with his sword. Overwhelmed by Odysseus’ courage and determination, Circe falls in love with him and agrees to transform the pigs back into men. After this, they stay on the island for one year, during which Odysseus becomes Circe’s lover. The Underworld At the end of the year, Circe counsels Odysseus to go down to Hades and seek some advice from the seer Teiresias before continuing his journey. Odysseus does, and, in the process, he not only learns some of the hardships which lie before him, but also encounters many famous dead people (Agamemnon, Achilles, Heracles), including his mother's spirit, who tells him to hurry back home, since his wife Penelope is surrounded by potential suitors. Back at Aeaea, Circe restates some of these prophecies and warns Odysseus of many more dangers which await him. The Sirens First, Odysseus passes by the island of the Sirens who – as he is told by Circe – enchant all who come near them through the luring sound of their song. However, Odysseus orders his crew to stuff their ears with beeswax and tights himself tightly to the mast, so that he can not only escape unharmed but also hear the beautiful Sirens’ song. Scylla and Charybdis Then Odysseus’ ship must pass through a narrow strait located between the whirlpool Charybdis and the six-headed monster Scylla. It does, but not before Scylla manages to devour six of Odysseus’ men. The Cattle of Helios Next, they reach the island of Thrinacia, where Odysseus, remembering Circe’s and Teiresias’ warnings, cautions his shipmates not to eat the sacred cattle of the sun god Helios. In his absence, however, they do, and Helios, enraged, demands from Zeus to punish them, or else he would take the sun with him to the Underworld. Zeus obliges and sends a violent storm during which all of Odysseus’ shipmates – but him – die. Calypso The sea carries Odysseus to the island of Ogygia, where the witch Calypso falls in love with him and keeps him captive for the next seven years. All the while, Odysseus dreams of his beloved Ithaca and not even the promise of immortality manages to change his mind. Finally, through the intervention of Zeus and Hermes, at the end of the seven years, Odysseus is released. The Phaeacians He then reaches Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians (the modern-day island of Corfu). There, during a feast, Odysseus recounts his awe-inspiring story. Happy to have had the honor to welcome such an honorable guest, the Phaeacians provide Odysseus with a ship and a couple of sailors, who pilot the exhausted hero to Ithaca. After twenty years of warring and wandering, Odysseus is finally back home. Back in Ithaca Odysseus reaches Ithaca late at night, sound asleep. Not wanting to bother his sleep, the Phaeacian sailors lay him down on the shore and leave. Odysseus wakes up confused, but Athena appears to him and, after revealing to him what had happened, disguises him as an elderly beggar – both for his safety and so that he can learn better what had happened during his absence. Eumaeus Pretending to be a Cretan returning from Troy with some news of Odysseus, the disguised hero finds his way to the hut of one of his most faithful servants, the swineherd Eumaeus. Eumaeus welcomes him warmly, all the while speaking in superlatives for his past master. Telemachus Meanwhile, Telemachus has sailed home from Sparta, and, after evading an ambush set by the Suitors of Penelope, disembarks on the coast and goes straight to Eumaeus’ hut. Odysseus makes himself known to him, and the father and son are finally reunited – twenty years after being separated by the Trojan War and the ploy of Palamedes. Penelope and the Suitors Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus next heads for his own house. There, he is ridiculed by the Suitors, especially by Antinous, one of their two most prominent leaders, who even hurls a footstool at him and incites him to fight Irus, another beggar present at the palace. Suddenly, Penelope appears and, prompted by Athena, announces that she is finally ready to remarry. Happy to hear this – since it implies that Penelope has been faithful to him throughout all this time – Odysseus (still disguised) has a talk with his unsuspecting wife, during which Penelope is moved to tears to hear some (fake) news of Odysseus’ visit to Crete. Eurycleia Growing a fondness for this stranger, Penelope calls Eurycleia – Odysseus’ one-time wet-nurse – and asks her to wash the beggar’s feet. While doing this, Eurycleia notices a scar on his leg and realizes the identity of the stranger. She tries telling Penelope, but Odysseus and Athena intervene, and the secret stays safe. The Contest Urged by the beggar, Penelope announces the next morning that she would marry the Suitor able to string her husband's bow and then shoot an arrow through twelve ax shafts. None of the suitors manage to do it; Odysseus, still in disguise, completes the challenge and, afterward, reveals himself; helped by his son Telemachus and Athena, he slays all of the Suitors and hangs twelve of the household maids identified by Eurycleia as traitors. The Reunion of Odysseus and Penelope Eurycleia notifies Penelope of the unexpected outcome of the contest, joyously notifying her that the stranger had been none other than Odysseus all this time! Penelope does not believe her and refuses to acknowledge Odysseus’ identity even after coming down and seeing him bathed and clothed in royal attire, all but a god among humans. Understandably cautious, Penelope asks Odysseus to move her marriage-bed to another room. Odysseus replies that such a thing is impossible, as he had made the bed himself and knows that one of its legs is a still living olive tree deeply rooted in the ground. Penelope needs no further proof: she runs in her husband’s embrace, and both start weeping tears of joy. Gladdened, Athena orders Eos to postpone the dawn for a few hours, so that the two spouses can fully enjoy a lengthened night of embraces, tears and stories, of love and pleasure. The Death of Odysseus Not many things are known about Odysseus’ later years; or, to be more precise, too many contradictory stories are told by different authors. The more romantic state that he and Penelope lived happily ever after; the more skeptic that, after finding a proof of her infidelity, Odysseus either left or even killed Penelope and went on another journey to the kingdom of Thesprotia, where he eventually married Callidice. The most famous story of Odysseus’ death, however, concerns Telegonus, the son he fathered with Circe while on Aeaea. Once Telegonus reached adulthood, he went to Ithaca to meet his father. Landing on the shore, he killed some sheep to satisfy his hunger. Odysseus was not happy with this act and came out to confront him. In the fight which ensued, Odysseus was deadly wounded by Telegonus’ spear tipped with the poison of a sting-ray. After finding out the identity of his victim, Telegonus took both Penelope and Telemachus to Aeaea, where Circe made all three of them immortal. Afterward, the two sons married each other's mothers.

     // Minor Gods
     { id: 29, name: 'Pan', type:"MinorGod", title: 'Ruler of Nature and Pasturelands', imageUrl:"https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pan.jpg" , description: "The culture of Ancient Greece involved a complex spiritual world of major and minor gods that oversaw human events and engaged in dramas of their own. One of these, called Pan, ruled over nature and pasturelands. He is frequently depicted in literature and artworks. Although he is not one of the major gods of Ancient Greece, he is one of most often referenced figures in Greek mythology. Pan the God of the Wild Pan is considered to be one of the oldest of GREEK GODS. He is associated with nature, wooded areas and pasturelands, from which his name is derived. The worship of Pan began in rustic areas far from the populated city centers, and therefore, he did not have large temples built to worship him. Rather, worship of Pan centered in nature, often in caves or grottos. Pan ruled over shepherds, hunters and rustic music. He was the patron god of Arcadia. Pan was often in the company of the wood nymphs and other deities of the forest. Pan’s Appearance Perhaps because of his association with nature and animals, Pan did not have the appearance of a normal man. The bottom half of his body was like a goat, with the top half of his body being like other men. However, he is often depicted with horns on his head, and his face is usually unattractive. Pan’s Lineage The parentage of Pan is uncertain. Some accounts say he is the son of HERMES and Dryope, but others say he is the son of ZEUS or the son of Penelope, wife of Odysseus. The story of his birth says that his mother was so distressed by his unusual appearance that she ran away, but he was taken to Mount Olympus where he became the favorite of the gods. Pan’s Powers Like the other GODS OF OLYMPUS, Pan possessed enormous strength. He could also run for long periods of time and was impervious to injury. He could transform objects into different forms and was able to teleport himself from Earth to Mount Olympus and back. He is depicted as very shrewd with a wonderful sense of humor. In Ancient Roman mythology, a SIMILAR GOD is called Faunus. Pan and Music The MYTHOLOGICAL STORIES involving Pan usually involve his romantic interest in a lovely goddess of the woods who spurns his advances and gets turned into an inanimate object to escape him or who otherwise flees from his ugly appearance. One story concerns Syrinx, a beautiful wood nymph. She flees from Pan’s attentions, and her follow goddesses turn her into a river reed in order to hide her from him. As the winds blow through the reeds, they make a gentle musical sound. Because he does not know which reed Syrinx is, he cuts several from reeds from the group and set them in a line to make the musical instrument, the pan flute. Pan’s image is often depicted with this instrument. Pan Gave Humans the Word “Panic” One story involving Pan is the tale of war, in which Pan helps his friend survive a vicious struggle by letting out an immense cry that frightened the enemy and caused him to run away. From this story, we get the word “panic,” the sudden, uncontrollable fear that leads people into irrational behavior. Pan in the Modern World Over the ages, Pan has been a symbol of the force of nature. In the 1800s, interest in this mythological figure revived, and communities organized festivals in which Pan was the central figure. Mythical stories of Pan’s antics abound, and he continues to be a figure representing the ancient mystery of the forest, hunting activities and wildlife. Like the OTHER GODS of Ancient Greece, Pan embodies many of the qualities of the world over which he ruled. He is depicted as energetic, sometimes frightening, with the wild, unbridled creative force of nature that makes him an interesting, and often entertaining, character.", author:"Vincent" },

     { id: 31, name: 'Nemesis', type:"MinorGod",title:'Goddess of Retribution and Vengeful Fate', imageUrl:"https://img.17qq.com/images/qrsqsrttuax.jpeg",description: "In Greek Mythology, Nemesis was the Goddess of vengeful fate, rightful retribution, or revenge as represented in her name which has a rough translation of “to give what is due” from Greek language/ dialect to English. She was later also known as Rhamnousia and Rhamnusia. Nemesis is usually seen holding a sword, but in some images she can be seen holding a balance, scales or measuring rod. She has enormous wings and travels in a chariot drawn by Griffins.There are many different theories on the origins of Nemesis; one of them described her as the offspring of either Oceanus or Zeus, but according to the Greek poet Hesiod (750-650 BC), Nemesis was supposedly the child of Erebus (The god of darkness) and Nyx (The goddess of night/shadow), while others believed that Nemesis was given life from Nyx alone. In some (a moderate amount) of metaphysical lore/ mythology, Nemesis is believed to have mated with Zeus, unwillingly, giving life to two different sets of twins, the first included Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra, while the second set included The Dioscuri (helpers of mankind and held to be patrons of travelers and of sailors in particular, who invoked them to seek favorable winds) Castor and Pollux. Even though many believed that Leda was the mother of Helen, the book Bibliotheke notes that Nemesis is indeed the mother of Helen: Zeus was known for his temptation in cheating on Hera with both magical and non-magical beings. In order to avoid Zeus's advances in mating, Nemesis transformed herself into a goose, which was later impregnated by Zeus as he transformed himself into a swan. Nemesis later produced an egg (Helen), while in her goose form and gave it to a shepherd who eventually passed it onto Leda.In Nemesis, the Roman State and the Games, author Michael B. Hornum describes the temple to Nemesis and the sanctuary at Rhamnous – in some aspects, Nemesis is called Rhamnousia after the location of her sanctuary. Statues to Nemesis have been discovered dating back to the fifth century b.c.e. in Rhamnous, and inscriptions from the fourth century b.c.e. indicate that the cult of Nemesis was led by priestesses", author:"Anis" },
